my first crack at learning how to code
I am a life long lover of technology who finally got over the fear and took the dive into the tech pool.  Now I want to learn everything I possibly can about coding, hacking (ethically), cyber security, networking...everything.  It's fun learning new things and I'm excited about this new journey.
